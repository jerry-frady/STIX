This operation was conducted from May through December 2019. It was discovered due to the reference to an image file in a webpage that linked to a domain associated with a C&C server used by the Hisoka malware. Analysis of the HTML content showed the attackers may have been attempting to harvest visitors' NTLM credentials by causing their browsers to attempt to connect to a remote share which would require an NTLM challenge-response authentication attempt. Because of this, the attackers may have been able to obtain the account name, NTLM hashes, and some system information from the victim. The attackers could then attempt to crack the hashes. The hashes might also be used to carry out a replay attack. Further indicators, such as DNS redirections, linked the activity to other xHunt activities and also an apparent relationship to activities of the OilRig (aka APT34 and itg13 as identified by IBM) and Chafer (aka APT39 and itg07 as identified by IBM) groups.
